![alt](readme_assets/img.gif)
SoftManiSim is an advanced, open-source simulation framework designed for multi-segment continuum manipulators, offering a significant leap forward in accuracy and flexibility. Unlike traditional simulators, which often rely on simplifying assumptions like constant curvature bending and omission of contact forces, SoftManiSim employs a robust and rapid mathematical model to achieve precise, real-time simulations. Its versatility allows seamless integration with various rigid-body robots, making it applicable across a broad range of robotic platforms. Additionally, SoftManiSim supports parallel operations, enabling the simultaneous simulation of multiple robots and generating essential synthetic data for training deep reinforcement learning models.
